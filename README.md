# Prodigy Infotech Internship Task 01

As part of my Prodigy Infotech internship, I completed Task 1 focused on analyzing global population data. The project involved cleaning and preprocessing raw data from various sources, including countries' population data from 1960 to 2023. Using Python and libraries like Pandas and Matplotlib, I performed various analyses, such as identifying population distribution, sorting countries by population, and visualizing trends across years.


## Dataset

The dataset used for this task is [World Population Data](API_SP.POP.TOTL_DS2_en_csv_v2_56.csv). This dataset contains records of population from the year 1960 to 2023.
## Tools and Libraries:

* Jupyter notebook
* Pandas
* Numpy
* Matplotlip & Seaborn for visualization
## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

During the EDA process, I performed the following steps:

* Data Cleaning: Checked for missing values, duplicates, and outliers in the dataset and handled them accordingly.

* Visualization: Created a bar chart, stacked chart to visualize the distribution of a categorical or continuous variable.
## Conclusion

In conclusion, The final output included insightful plots representing population growth, country comparisons, and cumulative population changes, providing valuable insights into global demographic shifts over decades. This analysis lays the foundation for further exploration and modeling tasks in the data science workflow.

Thank you for reviewing my submission!
